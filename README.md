# Weather App

This is a weather application built with Node.js that provides current weather information using the Weatherstack API and geocoding data from the OpenCageData API.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

1. Open the command line or terminal.
2. Navigate to the `weather-server` directory using the command `cd weather-server`.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Go to the `src` directory using `cd src`.
5. Start the application using `nodemon app.js`.

## APIs Used

The Weather App utilizes the following APIs:

1. **Weatherstack API**: This API provides access to real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. To learn more about the Weatherstack API and obtain an API key, visit [Weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/).

2. **OpenCageData API**: This API is used for geocoding, converting location names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). It allows the Weather App to retrieve weather information based on user-provided locations.
